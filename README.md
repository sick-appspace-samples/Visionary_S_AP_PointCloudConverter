Show how to calculate a full pointcloud and only a subpart of the image as pointloud in Lua.
### Description
Set up the camera to take live images continuously and automatically calculate
pointclouds out of it. First the full Z image is converted to a pointcloud
and shown via the left Viewer. As second sample only a subset of the image
in form of a pixel region is converted to a pointcloud to show how to save
performance and convert only what you need to a pointcloud.
